Master Traus:<br>Elves have lived here in Innadril for a very long time, since the Elder Terestien and his followers arrived here from Oren. Back then they were called the "Elves of the Lake" and they intermingled with the natives of this area. Marriages between Elves and Humans were common then, and so Elven blood mixed with the Humans of Innadril. That's why the people here are so much longer-lived than elsewhere.<br>Had you already heard that story?<br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skills.</a><br><a action="link skillenchant_help.htm">Ask about Skill Enchanting.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
