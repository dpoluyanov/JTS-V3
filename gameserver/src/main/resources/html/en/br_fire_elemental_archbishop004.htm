<html><body><br>I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. It's easy. <br>When you're out hunting monsters, you will find the "Seed of Fire" and "Explosive Seed of Fire".<br>Double click on the Seeds of Fire and a Spirit of Fire will appear. They may look dangerous, but they're still young and not very strong.<br> But as they are aggressive, you'll be in trouble if you choose not to fight. Once summoned, you will be blessed with the buff Eva's Wrath. It is only with this buff that you will be able to take down the Spirit's of Fire. <br><b><font color="LEVEL">And only your bare hands will make you victorious against these disgruntled spirits. Your weapons will be completely ineffective, so don't even bother.</font></b><br>When the spirit dies, the treasures it held will fall on the ground, so remember that.<br>Also, as the spirits are killed, their souls are collected in the Obelisk you can see behind me. Once enough spirit's souls have been collected, you can receive Eva's Blessing.<br><br><a action="link br_fire_elemental_archbishop014.htm">What's Eva’s Wrath?</a><br> <a action="link br_fire_elemental_archbishop001.htm">Back</a>
