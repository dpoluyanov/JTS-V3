<body>Dimensional Gate Keeper:
<br>I stand here to protect this world.
<br>You, who fight to obtain the seal's power. Do you know the danger we faced when the seal was loosened? You might not have felt it, but a dimensional rift has appeared in our world, and the demons in purgatory have already begun to stream through. There were people who realized the danger and mustered their strength, but they barely managed to hold back the tide ...
<br>We are still too weak. Will you join us?
