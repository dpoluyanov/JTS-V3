Guard Bret:<br>Having the border so close to the capital city makes me very nervous.  Things have quieted down now, but if Elmore were to attack I fear that the border guards would not be able to resist at all. There was talk for a while of opening the border entirely, but now they seem to be on a higher level of alert than ever before. I pray that nothing triggers the resumption of hostilities...<br><a action="link guard_bret002.htm">"What is on the other side of the border?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
