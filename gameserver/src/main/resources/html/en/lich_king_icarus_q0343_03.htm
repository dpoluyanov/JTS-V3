Would you care for a nip? It really tastes wonderful!<br>No? Well, I understand. It would most likely burn your tongue right out! <br>Did I understand that you are a student of Hardin? Or, are you just a flunkie from the Ivory Tower? Well, no matter! A gift like this is always welcome! Please take this as a token of my appreciation!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=343&reply=2">Return</a></body></html>
