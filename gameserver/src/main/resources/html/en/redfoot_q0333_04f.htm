Mercenary Redfoot:<br>Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br>It's Spidersilk Rope!  It's a very strong and light rope that is made from the spidersilk that is collected from the tarantula's webs in the Spine Mountain Range.  If you take it to a store, you should be able to get a very good price for it.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Return</a></body></html>
