Blacksmith Hilda:<br>Do you have any business for blacksmith Hilda? Hilda is busy! I need to make swords, plows, polearms, and armor! If you came here to visit, don't talk to Hilda, just look. Hilda doesn't make any mistakes even if someone is watching, but if someone talks to Hilda while Hilda is working, someone might get hit by hammer. In the face.
