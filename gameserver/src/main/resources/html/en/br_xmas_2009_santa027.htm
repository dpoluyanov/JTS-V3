<html><body>It's our reindeer - they've unionized! They've all gone on holiday together, claiming I've not given them enough time off! They get three hundred and sixty four days a year off!<br>What should I do? I can't not give out <font color="LEVEL">Christmas Gifts</font>, but I can't carry those gifts around on my own....<br>Hmm, I could get my Elf friends to send me some baby reindeers, but they're too young to pull my sleigh and raising them takes constant affection and feeding... I can't do it on my own!<br> Perhaps somebody else could raise the reindeers and then donate them back... somebody like you! No no - don't look around, you're definitely the one to help me.<br>Take care of this baby reindeer for one hour and raise it well to become an adult, okay? Remember, no reindeer, no Christmas gifts this year, and all the little boys and girls who have been SO good all through the year will have nothing to show for it! And then what? They'll see no point in being good, and in a few years time you'll have a whole generation of terrors to put in their place!<br>Think about it, adventurer - the success of this year's Christmas all depends on you!<br><a action="link br_xmas_2009_santa028.htm">"Brilliant. What about rewards then?"</a><br><a action="link br_xmas_2009_santa029.htm">"Hmm...
