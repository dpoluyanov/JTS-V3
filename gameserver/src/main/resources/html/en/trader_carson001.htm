Trader Carson:<br>Welcome, customer! Is there anything specific that you're looking for today? We have a wide selection of earrings, necklaces, rings and more. In fact, I daresay that we have any accessory worth having. That's the difference between Elmore and Aden, eh? Here in Aden, we believe elegance is always worth the price -- not like those savages to the north! Well, have a look around. Whatever your budget, I'm sure you'll find something that pleases you.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy Accessories.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=1">Buy dye.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=629">Buy Bracelets and Talismans.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=4">Buy Common Items.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=8">Sell.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
