<HTML><HEAD><BODY>Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>You're very brave!<br>The best meat is obtained after a beast has grown a bit. Not too young, nor fully grown... If they've become vicious, their meat will be bitter. You'll get a better feeling for this when you've done it a while...<br>Bring me <font color="LEVEL">120 pieces of meat</font>... I need that much for one shipment. Please bring only the highest quality meat! It's for Mr. Vladimir! I'm counting on you!</BODY></HTML>
