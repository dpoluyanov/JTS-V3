<BODY> Mercenary Captain Pierce: <br>I'm glad to have you on the force! Makes me more optimistic about our chances... <br>Anyway, I called you here to ask you a favor. I sent a group of scouts into the Swamp of Screams to investigate the ongoing conflict there, but we've lost contact with one of them. I need someone to find out what happened.  Are you up to the task? <br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">"Sure, no big deal. I'll do it."  </a> </BODY></HTML>
