Priest of Blessing:<br>
Nevit's Hourglass is an item which extends your Bonus Recommendation time for a certain duration (which is designated by your level).<br>
In essence, the Hourglass buff pauses your Bonus Time. But once the buff ends, the time continues as normal.<br>
Here are some things you should keep in mind:<br>
- Should you die or switch between your main and subclasses, the buff will end.<br>
- You can only receive the item every 20 hours, and the waiting time is shared by all characters on the account.<br>
- There are level ranges to Nevit's Hourglass. The 20 hour time limit does not apply to different levels of the item, i.e. your level 20 character can receive the item at the same time as your level 85.<br>
- In addition, once your character moves to a new level range, you don't have to wait to get another Hourglass.<br>
- As with Nevit's Voice, if you save up several Hourglasses, you can use them all at once.<br><br>
The Hourglass level ranges and prices are as follows:<br>
Level 1-19: 4,000 Adena<br>
Level 20-39: 30,000 Adena<br>
Level 40-51: 110,000 Adena<br>
Level 52-60: 310,000 Adena<br>
Level 61-75: 970,000 Adena<br>
Level 76-79: 2,160,000 Adena<br>
Level 80-85: 5,000,000 Adena<br>
