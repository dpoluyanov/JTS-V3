<html><head><body>Sergeant Allenos:<br>The Seed of Destruction is currently occupied by Keucereus' clan. Every entrance is open, so there's no restriction in moving through its interior.<br>Find Officer Edric in Central Square and he'll assign you several missions.<br>We have also received reports about a mysterious energy emanating from several fissures inside the Seed.<br>We have also heard that the Dragon race is preparing to attack us. We estimate that the attack will come 12 hours after we occupy the Seed of Destruction. Even if we win that battle, chances are that they will launch surprise attacks from time to time. They certainly know the terrain better than we do!</body></html>
