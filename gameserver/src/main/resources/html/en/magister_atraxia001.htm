Magister Atraxia:<br>I have been here for some time now, but I still have trouble with this cold weather. When it gets too frigid, I endure it by thinking of my balmy Elven homeland. <br>We Elves are closely attuned to our environment. That is the essence of our magic and our strength. May Einhasad guide you on your path, my friend.<br><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skills.</a><br><a action="link skillenchant_help.htm">Ask about Skill Enchanting.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
