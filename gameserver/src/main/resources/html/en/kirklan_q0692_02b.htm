<html><head><body>Kirklan:<br>The <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction's Collectable Seed</font> is <font color="LEVEL">Dragonkin Charm</font>. The problem is that this is really rare, and chances are that you will only find Dragonkin Charm Fragments. If you bring me 5 Dragonkin Charm Fragments I'll be able to create a Dragonkin Charm. Also, if you come across a <font color="LEVEL">Tiat Charm</font> while you are in the Seed of Destruction, bring it to me. I'll trade you that for some Adena.<br>Do you understand?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=692&reply=1">You understand.</a><br><a action="link kirklan_q0692_01d.htm">Ask about other Collectable Seeds and Collectable Seed Fragments.</a></body></html>
