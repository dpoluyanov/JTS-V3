Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>Ah, it is always such a pleasure to see a fresh-faced traveler! My name is Sophya. I  command the 4th platoon of the Black Lion Mercenary Troop. We have been hired by the mayor of the Town of Dion to drive away evil spirits. I fear that I underestimated the number of evil spirits in this place when I took this job.<br>If you plan to travel in the vicinity of Gludio or Giran you should prepare yourself for attack from an Enku Orc or a dire wolf. You look skillful enough, I expect that you will survive.<br><a action="link sophia002.htm">"Tell me about the Black Lion Mercenary Troop."</a><br><a action="link sophia003.htm">"Tell me about evil spirits in the area."</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
