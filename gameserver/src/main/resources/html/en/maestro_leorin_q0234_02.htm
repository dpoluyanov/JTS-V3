woman...? I don't know. I had never seen her before. She was quite beautiful, 
with blonde hair and blue eyes. She said that soon I would have an important 
visitor and that I should make a top-quality weapon for that person! Sadly, I've 
been thrown out of the guild. I explained to her that I no longer make weapons. 
But she wouldn't accept any of my excuses. She said that I would know after 
meeting you that I must once again pick up the hammer.<BR>But what am I to do? I 
drank away the money she gave me... Even if I wanted to make a weapon for you, I 
don't have the money to pay for the materials I need!<BR><A
