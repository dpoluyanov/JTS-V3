Mercenary Redfoot:<br>Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br>Machine parts?  This appears to be the mark of the Black Anvil Guild. I'm not sure, but I think these parts are used by Dwarves to repair golems.  If you take them to a store you should be able to sell them for a good price.
