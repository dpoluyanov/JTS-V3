<html><body>Well, if you take good care of one of the reindeer until it becomes an adult, you'll receive the <font color="LEVEL">Christmas Buff</font> from the reindeer. The buff will allow you to have so much more fun when you hunt, and there's even a chance that Rudolphina will appear.<br>Once I have enough reindeer, I'll go everywhere and give out the Christmas gifts myself, and I'll give out the very best presents to those who battle with the monsters!<br>You'll also find 2 exchange coupons in your gift box.<br>They're the <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Exchange Coupons</font> and <font color="LEVEL">T-shirt Exchange Coupons</font>. Bring them to me so I can make you some great enchanted weapons and T-shirts. Who knows? You might even find a <font color="LEVEL">+12 enchanted A Grade weapon</font>!<br>Well, go ahead and raise a reindeer! Time's a tickin'!<br><br><a action="link br_xmas_2009_santa001.htm">Return</a></body></html>
