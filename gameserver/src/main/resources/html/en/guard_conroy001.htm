Guard Conroy:<br>Have you been to Lake Narcel, south of the village?  Once you could rent a boat at the pier or fish from the lakeside... It was quite charming.

Could this signal the rebirth of our precious lake? That would be marvelous!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
