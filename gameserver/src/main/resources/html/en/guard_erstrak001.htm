Guard Erstack:<br>Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo?

The best kinds are then hauled out and left to age in either the <font color="LEVEL">Den of Evil</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Crypts of Disgrace</font>.  Dangerous?  Sure!  But believe you me, no imitation even comes close!<br><a action="link guard_erstrak002.htm">"Tell me about the Den of Evil." </a><br><a action="link guard_erstrak003.htm">"Tell me about the Crypts of Disgrace."</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">"Who is the Lord of the manor and what is the tax rate?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
