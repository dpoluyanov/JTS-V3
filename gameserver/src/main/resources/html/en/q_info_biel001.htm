<body>Criticism of Biel's Song:
<br><font color="LEVEL">An ancient poet and a modern singer,</font>
<br>Biel is the greatest Swordsinger born of the Elves. He was the queen's most admired singer, and once he even performed before Shaiha.
<br>However, if you now examine the records from the time, the subject of magic will undoubtedly surface. The songs of that time were praises to the gods, so they were also taught out of deference to Eva. But as time went by and it became the age of humans, the songs came to be enjoyed by the other races.
<br>This is also the case of the Swordsinger's song. A Swordsinger who has experience singing by himself and swinging his sword will understand the importance of an audience.
