<html><body>That Turkey is not a usual turkey. <br>You cannot touch the Turkey at all with weapons you have.<br>If you take a look at the hat I gave you, there is the rock-paper-scissors skill which can defeat the Turkey. So, please make the best use of it. <br>As a precaution, you should regard <font color="LEVEL">timing</font> as important when fight it out with the Turkey. <br>If the timing is not right, there is no use.<br>And winning once is not enough. You must win 4 consecutive times. <br>Please~ don't forget it.<br><br><a action="link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2001.htm">Back to the beginning</a></body></html>
