<html><head><body>Magister Winonin:<BR>I have had a growing sense of dread of late. 
Something terrible is coming. Can you hear it? The trees in the forest, the 
birds in the sky and the fish in the ocean... They know of what I speak...<BR>I 
fear for the survival of the whole Human race, but I don't know what threatens 
it! This dark foreboding will not give me any peace whatsoever. I hope I am 
wrong but I fear I am not...<BR>I must do what I can to save my race. I will 
find like-minded individuals to join my preparations for the coming apocalypse. 
If only we knew when...<BR>(This quest can only be undertaken by a character of 
level 40 or above.) </BODY></HTML>
