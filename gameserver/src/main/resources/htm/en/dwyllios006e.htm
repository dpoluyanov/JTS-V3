<html><head><body>Dilios:<br>The Seed of Infinity is being attacked! The Hall of Erosion and the Hall of Erosion are both being attacked by the undead! <br>The Seed of Life is being attacked by the followers of Ekimus. The Seed of Life is a major energy source, so we must protect it! If the tumors are completely revived, our enemies powers will be greatly strengthened, and their attacks against the Seed of Life will become nigh on unstoppable!<br>Also, you mustn't forget about the twin knights who were born in the Hall of Suffering. The tumors of death that they are trying to revive should be destroyed!<br>The Heart of Infinity is currently the only place where the seed energy can be extracted. If you're mindful of Ancient Gracia's powers, this place is still safe enough.<br><a action="link dwyllios001.htm">Back</a></body></html>
