Forest of Mirrors are the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors ghosts, mirrors, 
and Harit Lizardmen</font>. <br>Remember that you cannot fill your crystal 
completely with the souls of weaker beings. Over time the crystal demands 
greater evil. If you find that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, try 
killing creatures of more evil.</body></html>
