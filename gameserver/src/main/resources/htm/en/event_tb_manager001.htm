<html><head><body>Alchemist's Servitor:<br>Are you familiar with the <font color="LEVEL">Philosopher's Stone</font>? A Philosopher's Stone has the power to manifest items from your wildest dreams! My creator, the diminutive alchemist Sir Edward, completed the research on creating the Philosopher's Stone. Resting around me are the boxes that contain the necessary materials to create the Philosopher's Stones. 
<br>But alas, the keys to the boxes were lost after the monster attacks. Locate the <font color="LEVEL">Alchemist's Chest Keys</font>, and you can use them to open the Alchemist's Chests!  Please only use the Philosopher's Stone for good.
