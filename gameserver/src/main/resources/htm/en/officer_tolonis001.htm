Officer Tolonis:<br>I am Officer Tolonis, and I'm in charge of delivering supplies like Energy Stones to adventurers.<br>I used to be a platoon leader, but after I was injured they gave me this posting. I'm proud of what I do here, but I miss the life of battle. Oh well, I suppose somebody has to manage supplies.<br>If you're interested in acquiring the collection skill, perhaps I can help.  <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=648">Buy supplies or books.</a><br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn collection skill.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
