<html><head><body>Elder Casian:<br>Did you also feel the wave of magic emanate from Hellbound a few days ago? <br>Hmm, given your power level, it's odd that you didn't feel it... <br>I have been conducting my own investigation recently. I discovered that the path to Hellbound has been opened. Fortunately, it is not due to Beleth awakening. I believe it is rather the strength of the Witch that has broken the barrier. If you wish to go to Hellbound, I think you should go find the Witch. <br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">"Is there another way?"</a></body></html>
