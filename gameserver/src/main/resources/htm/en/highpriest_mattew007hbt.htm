High Priest Marie:<br>Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must bring me the Mark of Faith. Perhaps <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt in Gludin Village</font> can help you to find it. <br>He belongs to the Central Priest Order and can always be found at the Temple in the northeastern part of Gludin Village.  Pass the test he gives you and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font>, I'll make you a Cleric. <br><a action="link highpriest_mattew007hb.htm">Return</a></body></html>
