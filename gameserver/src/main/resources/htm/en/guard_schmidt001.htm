Guard Schmidt:<br>Howdy, stranger! Welcome! You're really brave to be here at a time like this! Or just lucky maybe? Ha!
<br>I've had enough of danger myself, thank you! I'd rather stay home and relax with my georgeous wife! When the stakatos are driven out of the Swamp of Screams and the land is cultivated, I'll be the first to build my own farm!
<br>Well, first I have to find a georgeous wife... Can you believe I'm still single?!<br><a action="link guard_schmidt002.htm">"Tell me about the Swamp of Screams." </a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">"Who is the lord of the manor and what is the tax rate?"</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
