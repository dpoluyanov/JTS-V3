<html><body>Oh, something awful has happened!  Our Santa Claus has captured by the misguided turkey near the Dwarven Village. <br>I want to help him, but I'm too busy because it's Christmas...  Heu heuk. And I'm a Santa Trainee, so I can't hand out Christmas gifts on behalf of Santa Claus. If Santa Claus could not be rescued, there's no gifts this year~ <br>Please rescue Santa Claus by taking match with the Turkey. I heard the stupid Turkey can't stand to see people being pleasant during Christmas...<br><br>If you want to take match with the Turkey, <font color="LEVEL">"rock-paper-scissors"</font>needs to be mastered.<br><br><a action="link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2026.htm">Get Even Information.</a><br><a action="link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2002.htm">Receive rock-paper-scissors Santa Hat.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=50000&reply=2">Receive the appreciative buff.</a><br><a action="link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2007.htm">Exchange weapons with the weapon exchange ticket. </a></body></html>
