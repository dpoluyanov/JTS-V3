First, though, let me tell you that I know that the one who gave you this task is the chief of the powers arrayed against us. But hear me! My purpose in meeting with you now is not to try and win you to our cause. I simply wish to give you all the facts.<br>I don't know if you are aware of it, but I recently journeyed to the Kamael town as an aide to Sir Klaus Vasper, the Human representative at the Giran Meeting. How can I describe the experience? It was transformative, and I feel an obligation to share what I discovered with others.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=127&reply=21">Listen carefully.</a> </body></html>
