He said he would earn cash as an adventurer.<br>I hear he's actually pretty good, he takes on quests other adventurers couldn't. But he's family, so I'm worried. I wanted to help. <br>And... <font color="LEVEL">You even gave me Trident</font>, but I need to ask another favor. <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=42&reply=1">Ask what it is.</a></body></HTML>
