<body>Adventure Guildsman:<br>Welcome! You need information?
<br>Information is as important to an adventurer as strength and courage. Don't you know that your path to glories is plainer if you know where to go to get good jobs! You can't get much attention if you go to the ruins everyone else already explored or if you catch evil creatures that others have already hunted... Listen to me very carefully...
