<html><head><body>Chamberlain Frederick:<br>My lord, might I suggest that you open negotiations with <font color="LEVEL">Agripel</font> again? If he fails to respond, wait a while. I suspect he will change his tune when he gets word of what has happened! Then you should have a strong hand with which to negotiate. But do not let him think you planned this, my lord! </body></html>
