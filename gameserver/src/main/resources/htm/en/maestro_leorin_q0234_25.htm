<html><head><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>Did you bring all 984 Grade B Crystals?  You came just in time. We've reached the perfect temperature for inserting the Crystals...<br>Uh huh, it's not over yet! I still need one more ingredient. Pure Infernium is too soft to be made into weapons.It must be mixed with high quality Mithril in order to make an alloy.<br>But it's just so hard to find good Mithril ore these days... The most reliable method is to melt a Grade B weapon down and use it instead. Understand?<br><font color="LEVEL">Now then, what kind of Grade B weapon can you bring? I'll have to adjust the temperature and the component ratio for the molten liquid, so you cannot change the type of weapon later. Choose carefully!</font><br><font color="LEVEL">Also, you have to understand that any Enchantment or special capability the weapon possesses will disappear once it is thrown into the furnace! Don't forget that augmented weapons are useless. Standard weapons are also useless!</font><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25a.htm">Sword of Damascus.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25b.htm">Samurai Dualsword.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25c.htm">Bow of Peril.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25d.htm">Lance.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25e.htm">Art of Battle Axe.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25f.htm">Staff of Evil Spirits.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25g.htm">Demon Dagger.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25h.htm">Bellion Cestus.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25i.htm">Deadman's Glory.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25k.htm">Guardian Sword.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25l.htm">Wizard's Tear.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25m.htm">Star Buster.</a><br><a action="link maestro_leorin_q0234_25n.htm">Kaim Vanul's Bones.</a></body></html>
