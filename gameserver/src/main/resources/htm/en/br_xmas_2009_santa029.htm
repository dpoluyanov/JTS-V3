<html><body>Your reindeer must be taken care of with great affection and love! You can't just walk him around with you <font color="LEVEL">and expect it just grow into an adult</font>, oh no!<br>You see, your reindeer must be fed with the food you gather from hunting. The fruits are the things they like the most, so keep an eye out for them. You'll also have to show the little fellow a great deal of love and affection! During <font color="LEVEL">certain times</font>, your reindeer will signal to you for attention, and when that happens, use your "Reindeer Scratch" skill on the guy, and he'll be all giddy with joy!<br>After one hour of proper care, your reindeer will turn into an adult. When that happens, you'll have ten minutes with him before he runs back here to prepare for the big Christmas push!<br><br><a action="link br_xmas_2009_santa001.htm">Return</a></body></html>
