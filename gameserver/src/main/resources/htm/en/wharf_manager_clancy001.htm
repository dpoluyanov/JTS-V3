Wharf Manager Clancy:<br>Welcome! Are you here to board a ship? Ship traffic has increased a lot now that routes to Elmore are opened again. At first it was just cargo, but now we have enough interest to operate a passenger liner. It's nice to see all the activity again! <br>Ah, a liner heading to the Town of Rune is about to leave. Would you like to buy a ticket?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy a ticket.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
