Merchant Zenkin:<br>Come on in, customer! Welcome to the most honest shop in northern Aden.<br>There are people spreading nonsense that I, Zenkin, am a wanted criminal from Elmore or a disguised Timak Orc. Can you believe those lunatics? Well, you look like you can tell a hawk from a handsaw, so I trust you won't believe such ridiculous tales.<br>Anyway, have a look around. Let me know if you see anything you like, eh?<br><a action="link zenkin010.htm">Buy/Sell/Refund.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=2">Try on Fighter equipment.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=3">Try on Wizard equipment.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
