Father Gupu:<br>Thank you so much. Windy has just returned! She must be inside washing up!<br>Windy! You little rascal! Do you know how worried I was?! Pull one more stunt like that, and you'll get a spanking you will never forget!<br>Thank you for finding this child. Making a donation and finding a lost child...

It looks like a trinket that she picked up while playing in the Wastelands...<br><a action="link father_gupu_q0226_07.htm">Ask about the saint.</a></body></html>
