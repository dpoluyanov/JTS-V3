<html><head><body>Galate:<br>He is a Wizard who disappeared 1,000 years ago. I don't think anyone alive has ever seen him. He was a genius without peer, but he possessed a dark and dangerous soul. <br>In my estimation, he is the one who realized the beginning and the end of magic. Since you came from the mainland, you have probably visited Gludio, eh? Have you heard that the wilderness of southern Gludio was created by Beleth? Well, we could spend all night talking about Beleth and his dark deeds... <br>Would you help me as a favor to Priest Kanis? <br><a action="link galate002a.htm">Say that you will help.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
