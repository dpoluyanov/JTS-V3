Prefect Chakiris:<br>Hey you!<br>I am in charge of the guild here in Hunters Village. Open your ears and listen to what I say.<br>There are 3 things you must remember here in Hunters Village: 1), whether people or prey, judge no one based on their appearance; 2) go to the hunting grounds only with trusted comrades; and 3) always obey my commands without hesitation. That is the most important precept!<br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skills.</a><br><a action="link skillenchant_help.htm">Ask about Skill Enchanting.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
