<html><head><body>Shadai<br>Greetings, traveler! I am Shadai of Hellbound, the legendary Dwarven blacksmith. Ah, I know I may look a bit shabby, but you mustn't judge a sword by its sheath! Ha ha ha! You are a lucky fellow, my friend, to have bumped into me. Interested in turning that luck into wealth? I'll make you a deal: if you get me an item I need, I'll use my skills to craft you something.<br> <a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1006&reply=1">Ask about Ancient Adena.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=624">Process the cursed Seal Stones.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=625">Exchange a shoulder ornament to enhance the power of armor.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=617">Enhance power of armor.</a> <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-303&reply=616">Remove power from armor.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
