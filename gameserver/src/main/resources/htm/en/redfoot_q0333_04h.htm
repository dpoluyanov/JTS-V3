Mercenary Redfoot:<br>Shall we open the box?  This lock should be no problem for me... There we go...  That was too easy.  Now, what do we have here?<br>A silver bowl and a teacup?

I don't buy such exquisite items but if you take them to a store, you should be able to sell them for a good price.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Return</a></body></html>
