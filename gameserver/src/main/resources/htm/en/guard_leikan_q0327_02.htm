<html><head><body>Guard Leikan:<BR>At one time the land northwest of Gludio was fertile 
farmland, yielding bountiful harvests of wheat and barley. During the dark days 
of the invasion of Gracia, when the farmers were in hiding, the land was taken 
over by the filthy Turek orcs. <BR>Some day, my people will drive them out 
and restore the farmland to its previous state...<BR>One of the farmers, Piotur, 
has taken the initiative to drive the <font color="LEVEL">Turek orcs </font>from 
his land. He is looking for a few good mercenaries.<BR>This should be easy for 
you. Do you wish to help the farmers regain their land?<BR>
