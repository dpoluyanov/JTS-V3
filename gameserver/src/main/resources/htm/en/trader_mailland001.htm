Trader Mailland: <br>You must have a good eye for quality, since you stopped in here -- mark my words, too many adventurers these days choose accessories based solely on appearance. With that in mind, I'd steer clear of that Human woman's accessory shop if I were you. They say she keeps the good items for herself. That's not the way we do business here! <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=0">Buy.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=4">Buy Common Items.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=8">Sell.</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1000&reply=1">Ask about the local lord and tax rate.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest.</a></body></html>
