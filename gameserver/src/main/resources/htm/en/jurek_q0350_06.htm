<html><head><body>Grand Magister Jurek:<br>A Soul Crystal derives its power from the souls of evil creatures.  It is best used on a creature who has first been weakened, and lacks the energy to resist.  When you have an evil creature halfway dead, apply your Soul Crystal to it. This will draw the creature's soul towards the crystal. Once the vile creature is slain, its soul will fully seperate from its body, and with luck be captured within the Soul Crystal.<font color="LEVEL">Each Soul Crystal can hold up to 10 souls.</font> More specifically, it can contain up to 10 souls with regular use. I will give you details after you've returned the Soul Crystal with 10 souls. <br>Be careful!  Collecting souls that can be used to infuse special powers into a weapon is no easy task! <br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=350&reply=8">"What kind of precautions should I take when collecting souls?"</a></body></html>
