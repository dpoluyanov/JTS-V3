<html><head><body>Guard Leikan:<BR>Bear in mind that this is a rumor, I've not seen it 
myself. I was told that mercenaries have been seen returning from the area near 
the Orc Barracks with relics from the Elmo-Aden period.<BR>Although they are 
little more than pottery shards, they fetch a high price. If you are interested 
you should visit a <font color="LEVEL">relics expert</font>.<BR>
