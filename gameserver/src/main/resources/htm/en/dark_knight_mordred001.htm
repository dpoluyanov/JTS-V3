Dark Knight Mordred:<br>No one understands injustice better than I do. I know the rage you feel. I know from personal experience your consuming need for vengeance.<br>Evil cannot be allowed to go unpunished! Revenge is not only desirable, it is necessary. To eradicate evil, those who commit evil acts must themselves be eliminated.<br>Listen to your rage! Release it to become an instrument of justice!<br><a action="bypass -h learn_skill">Learn skill.</a><br><a action="link skillenchant_help.htm">Ask about Skill Enchanting.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
